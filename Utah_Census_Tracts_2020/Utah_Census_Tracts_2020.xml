            <abstract>Last Update: 02/2021This datasets was was downloaded from the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) page. All 2020 census boundaries are current to January 1, 2020. The Census Bureau will release the first set of corresponding demographic data in September 2021 (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files). Following that release, AGRC will append the demographic data to the existing 2020 geographies served on this page.Census tracts are small, relatively permanent subdivisions of a county designed to present and compare statistical data for areas of roughly equal population. Census tracts generally contain between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum population of 4,000. A census tract is spatially smaller in a higher-density area and larger in a more sparsely populated area. In higher-density areas, tracts can be considered approximately “neighborhood” sized.Visit the SGID 2020 Census data pagefor more information.</abstract>
